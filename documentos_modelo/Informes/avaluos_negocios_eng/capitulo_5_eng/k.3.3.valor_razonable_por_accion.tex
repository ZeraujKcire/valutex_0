At the express request of the applicant, the appraiser proceeded to calculate the fair value corresponding to each share. Therefore, the number of shares available was first accounted for (according to the information provided by the applicant), and then the total fair value of the Equity was divided by the number of shares; thus obtaining a  \textcolor{principal}{unit value per share of \$328.19 pesos per share}, as can be seen:
